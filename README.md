For my project exam, I made a blogpage for a fake firm called HotView Labs. This firm is posting blogposts updating on the latest tech gear. 

## Description
For my project exam, I started with designing a website for a fictional blogpage called HotView Labs using Figma. Once satisfied with the design, I coded it using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The website includes a homepage with a carousel which shows the three newest blogposts. If you croll further down you can see the rest of the blogposts. You are also able to sort the blogposts after newest and oldest blogpost by pressing buttons on the homepage. If you are logged in as an admin on the page you can also create new, edit and delete blogposts. 

### Design Phase:
Figma Design: I began by creating the design in Figma. This tool helped me visualize the layout, color scheme, and overall aesthetics of the website. I attemted to make the design a little dark and choose fonts I felt like would fit into a tech blog. 

### Development Phase:
HTML, CSS and Javascript: When I finished designing the blogpage, I started coding the page. I started with the HTML and CSS files where I also put in image files to help me visualize how it would look after the elements from the API would be put in. Then I started coding the Javascript. 

### Features:
Homepage: The homepage provides a carousel showing the latest blogposts and a gallery showing all the blogposts made.

#### Logged in
Edit and create posts: If you are logged in you get a seperate page for editing and creating new posts. Here you can also delete posts if you are the author of the spesific post.

### Target Audience:
The website is designed to be appealing to tech-fans. People who are into the latest tech gear. This can be people of all ages, but directed at a spesific group.

This project teached me a lot about Javascript. I also learned what I want to do in future projects. In the future I want to work on making cleaner code.
